<p>This is a test in Markdown to check that this (temporary?) converter is working. If this works, I will continue this later, and the whole process will be a lot smoother. To convert this file to HTML, run <code>aditya_md.sh</code> and then run <code>preview.sh</code>. The website should be up at <code>localhost:8000</code>.</p>
<p>This seems to be working relatively well.</p>
