<p>This is a test in Markdown to check that this (temporary?) converter is working. If this works, I will continue this later, and the whole process will be a lot smoother. To convert this file to HTML, run <code>aditya_md.sh</code> and then run <code>preview.sh</code>. The website should be up at <code>localhost:8000</code>.</p>
<p>This seems to be working relatively well.</p>
<p>Algorithms are key to winning programming competitions.</p>
<p>The algorithms and techniques below are kind of ordered from easiest to hardest, asdf.</p>
<!-- need to use 4-space indent for sublists -->
 
<ul>
<li>Sorts
<ul>
<li>Bubble sort</li>
<li>Quicksort</li>
<li>Selection/insertion sorts</li>
<li>Merge sort</li>
<li>Radix sort</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Basic number theory
<ul>
<li>Sieve of Eratosthenes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dynamic programming
<ul>
<li>Fibonacci sequence, Pascal's triangle</li>
<li>Largest subsequence/substring sum</li>
<li>Longest common subsequence</li>
<li>Longest common substring (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance</a>)</li>
<li>Change with coins (least number of coins, and number of ways to make an amount of money)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>One website that is very helpful in practicing and mastering these techniques is <a href="https://uva.onlinejudge.org/">UVa Online Judge</a>. The website has a vast library of problems, including problems from old ICPC competitions.</p>
<p>Most, if not all, of the list above will be covered during our GAs, so be sure to come!</p>
