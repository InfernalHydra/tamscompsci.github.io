This is a test in Markdown to check that this (temporary?) converter is working.
If this works, I will continue this later, and the whole process will be a lot smoother.
To convert this file to HTML, run `aditya_md.sh` and then run `preview.sh`.
The website should be up at `localhost:8000`.

This seems to be working relatively well.
