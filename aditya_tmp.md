This is a test in Markdown to check that this (temporary?) converter is working.
If this works, I will continue this later, and the whole process will be a lot smoother.
To convert this file to HTML, run `aditya_md.sh` and then run `preview.sh`.
The website should be up at `localhost:8000`.

This seems to be working relatively well.

Algorithms are key to winning programming competitions.

The algorithms and techniques below are kind of ordered from easiest to hardest, asdf.

<!-- need to use 4-space indent for sublists -->
 * Sorts
     * Bubble sort
     * Quicksort
     * Selection/insertion sorts
     * Merge sort
     * Radix sort
 * Basic number theory
     * Sieve of Eratosthenes
 * Dynamic programming
     * Fibonacci sequence, Pascal's triangle
     * Largest subsequence/substring sum
     * Longest common subsequence
     * Longest common substring ([Levenshtein distance][levenshtein])
     * Change with coins (least number of coins, and number of ways to make an amount of money)

One website that is very helpful in practicing and mastering these techniques is [UVa Online Judge][uva].
The website has a vast library of problems, including problems from old ICPC competitions.

Most, if not all, of the list above will be covered during our GAs, so be sure to come!
